This assignment helped me improve my skills in working with APIs and handling real-time updates with JavaScript. I learned how to fetch and display messages dynamically, manage asynchronous functions, and handle user input. One challenge was ensuring messages were correctly formatted based on the sender, which improved my ability to manipulate the DOM and manage dynamic content.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About an hour to complete.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The Bootstrap display-4 class is used to apply a large font size to headings, making them more prominent on the page. It is typically used for larger headings like the main title of a page or section. The class scales the font size to a predefined value in the Bootstrap framework, ensuring the text stands out visually.
